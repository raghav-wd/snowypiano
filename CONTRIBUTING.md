## Getting Started

When contributing to Snowypiano, it's good to know our best practices, tips, and tricks. First, Snowypiano is written in TypeScript, CSS, and HTML (in order of language usage within the project); thus, we assume you are comfortable in these languages or have basic knowledge of them. At present, application doesn't have a backend. Furthermore, we use Prettier to format our code.

## Questions
If you have any questions, comments, concerns, or problems let me know on GitHub, or ask a question on Snowypiano's GitHub discussions and a contributor will be happy to assist you.
